# Cloud Bursting to GCP Codelab

Here are the exports from claat (https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools) in markdown and html formats.
The original document was written in Google Docs. At the moment, the <code> code </code> tags in the 
html does not render in Consolas or Courier New, so the viewing is not optimal. The html is best 
rendered from a Codelab server.
